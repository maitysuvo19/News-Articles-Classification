# News-Articles-Classification using different approaches
Text classification is a popular NLP task that assigns one or more categories to a given
piece of text from a larger set of possible categories. In this project, we classify news
articles into five different categories viz. ‘Sport’, ‘business’, ‘politics’, ‘tech’ and
‘entertainment’. From basic vectorization approaches, like Bag of Words, TF-IDF,
different word embeddings like Word2vec and Doc2vec have been used as advanced
vectorization techniques. As well as simple ML classification algorithms, a few deep
learning models were employed along with some pre-trained models for these news
articles classification tasks. Almost every model performed very well with an accuracy
score of more than 90. Finally, we interpreted and explained the classifier’s predictions
with the Lime and the Shap package.
